## Context

> _Complete blog post to come. Stay tunned_

`gradle-profiler-pttest` can analyse the outcomes of two benchmarks generated by [Gradle Profiler](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-profiler) with the [Paired T-test statistical technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test).

The goal is provide a super easy way to compare two benchmarks for Gradle builds - for the same task - without being [mislead by simple means](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-averages-are-often-wrong-1ff08e409a5b), since we are leveraging on a more robust statistical evidence on top of the outcomes.

This tool is built on top of [pingouin](https://pingouin-stats.org/), an opinionated Statistics library which leverages NumPy, Pandas and SciPy. Among other things, `gradle-profiler-pttest` features :

- An opinionated [hyphotesis test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing) (left-tailed) where we want to check if **modified build conditions** (_h1_) have a mean **statistically smaller** than the one we get from **baseline build conditions** (_h0_), which means better execution times given the modifications applied
- Auto-correction for benchmark samples with different sizes

Note that the ideal size for samples should be a small one - ideally between 10 and 30 measured builds - in order to make sense of T-student analysis.

## Installing

Install from your CLI with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)


```shell
pip install gradle-profiler-pttest
```

Requires **Python 3.8.5** or newer.

When running this tool on MacOS Catalina or newer, [please check instructions](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/building/macosx.html) in order to have SciPy properly installed in your local machine.

## Using

- Run the benchmarks with Gradle profiler for the status quo (`baseline`) and for the modifications applied the your Gradle project (`modified`)

- Supply the generated CSV files to `gradle-profiler-pttest`

```bash
gradle-profiler-pttest \
	-b <path/to/baseline/benchmark.csv> \
	-m <path/to/modified/benchmark.csv>
```

- Profit results

## Limitations

Right now `gradle-profiler-pttest` supports **only one Gradle task per supplied benchmark sample**, taking the first task executed as reference for the analysis given a multi-task [benchmarked scenario](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-profiler#advanced-profiling-scenarios).
