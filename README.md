# Paired T-tests for Gradle Benchmarks

> _Complete blog post to come. Stay tunned_


## Context

`gradle-profiler-pttest` can analyse the outcomes of two benchmarks generated by [Gradle Profiler](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-profiler) with the [Paired T-test statistical technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test). 

The goal is provide an easy way to compare two benchmarks for Gradle builds without being [mislead by simple means](https://thinkingneuron.com/statistics-data-science-why-mean-misleading/), since we are leveraging robust statistical evidence on top of the outcomes. 

This tool is built on top of [pingouin](https://pingouin-stats.org/), an opinionated Statistics library which leverages NumPy, Pandas and SciPy. Among other things, `gradle-profiler-pttest` features : 

- An opinionated [hyphotesis test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing) (left-tailed) where we want to test that **modified build conditions** (_h0_) have a mean **statistically lower** than **baseline build conditions** (_h1_), which means better execution times given the modifications under test 
- Auto-correction for benchmark samples with different sizes

Note that the ideal size for samples/benchmarks should be a small - ideally between 10 and 30 measured builds - in order to make sense of T-student analysis.

## Install with pip

Install from your CLI with `pip`


```shell
pip install gradle-profiler-pttest
```

Requires Python 3.8.+.

## Using

- Run the benchmarks with Gradle profiler for the status quo (`baseline`) and for the modifications applied the your Gradle project (`modified`)

- Supply the generated CSV files to `gradle-profiler-pttest` 

```bash
gradle-profiler-pttest \
	-b <path/to/baseline/benchmark.csv> \
	-m <path/to/modified/benchmark.csv>
```

- Profit results
